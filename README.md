### Salaam ðŸ‘‹, I'm Hendro

Iâ€™m currently working as Front End Developer, but still open to learning about other positions.

Moreover, as a game hobbyist, I did some casual game projects. Some projects for mobile use Augmented Reality as a feature. I wanna learn more about game development too.

Here are just a few of the technical skills I bring to the table:
- Web Development: HTML, JavaScript, Vue Js, Nuxt Js, Tailwind CSS
- Game Development: Unity (Game Engine)

other skills I'm currently learning: Typescript, Godot (game engine)

âš¡ and I am willing to learn other technical skills.

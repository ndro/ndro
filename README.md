### Salaam ðŸ‘‹, I'm Hendro

Iâ€™m currently working as **Software Engineer**, especially as a web developer. I do front-end development with Vue Js and Nuxt Js for some complex projects. Currently, I use Nest Js for back-end development, but I am still open to learning about other stacks and positions.

Moreover, as a game hobbyist, I did some casual game projects. Some projects for mobile use Augmented Reality as a feature. I want to learn more about game development too.

Here are just a few of the technical skills I bring to the table:
- Web Development
  - Front-end: **HTML, JavaScript, Vue Js, Nuxt Js, Tailwind CSS**
  - Back-end: **Node.Js, Nest.Js, Typescript**
- Game Development: **Unity** *(Game Engine)*

âš¡ and I am willing to **learn** other technical or non-technical skills.
